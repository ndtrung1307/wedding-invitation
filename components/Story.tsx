            John and Jane met in college during a study group for their Computer Science class. What started as a
            friendship quickly blossomed into love as they discovered their shared passion for technology and adventure.

            After graduation, they moved to the same city to pursue their careers. Their love grew stronger with each
            passing day, supporting each other through the ups and downs of life.

            On a beautiful summer evening, during a hike to their favorite spot overlooking the city, John got down on
            one knee and asked Jane to spend the rest of their lives together. She said yes, and now they're excited to
            begin this new chapter of their lives.
